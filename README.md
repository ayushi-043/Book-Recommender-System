# Book-Recommender-System
This Book Recommendation System is a machine learning project that suggests books similar to a user-selected title using collaborative filtering. Built with Python and powered by the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, it analyzes user ratings and book metadata to generate personalized recommendations. The model uses a precomputed similarity matrix for quick predictions and is deployed using Streamlit, offering an interactive web interface where users can select a book and receive suggestions along with cover images. The system leverages libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, with model components stored using Pickle for efficient loading and deployment.
